# FOZOS
## A tiny bit of history
  This is my third operating system. It is a rewrite of my previous one(OranGOS) to zig and x64
  with limine bootloader
## What is this for?
  I am developing FOZOS as a hobby project, however I will put as much effort as
  I can into developing this.
## Features implimented:
  1. TTY
  2. debug printing
## Build
  1. To build FOZOS first you must have these dependencies: make, zig(0.13.0), qemu, git, sgdisk, nasm
  2. run make in the root of the project
  3. That's it! project will now build for x64 which is the only currently supported architecture
  and it will also be run in qemu.
